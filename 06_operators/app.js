/*
Operators like +, -, *, /, %, etc. are used to perform operations on variables and values.

They are functions that act on values. For example, the + operator sums two values, the - operator subtracts one value from another, and so on.

They are special types of functions that take one or more values, perform an operation that you specify, and return a value.

It is called infix notation when an operator is placed between two operands. For example, 10 + 20.

Operators are FUNCTIONS!
